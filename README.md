# CYCLOGARD
Repository of the __CYCLOGARD__ project for the class Automation System's Project


## What's CYCLOGARD?
For the class Automation Systems Project, we were challenged to create a system to help protect cyclists: a device that detects incoming cars and alerts the cyclist of a possible danger, is also able to alert the vehicle driver with a sound or light warning, as well as to use the smartphone through an app to take a picture of the license plate number of the car, when the driver doesn't respect the minimum safety distance. All the data is store using an SQL server.

## Contents
This repository serves as a storage for all the code related to the microcontroller, Android app and SQL server.
